# Paint
A simple paint application made using SDL2


## Features
- Color palette consisting of 9 colors
- 4 different writing modes (brush, straight line, circle and rectangle drawing)
- Erasing Mode
- Save painting feature


## Use of the Application
The application is supported with keyboard shortcuts, the '1' key to switch to brush mode, the '2' key to switch to straight line mode, the '3' key to switch to circle drawing mode and the '4' key to switch to the rectangle drawing key.

While drawing can be done with the left click of the mouse, the eraser works with the right click. For continuity, it is necessary to keep the relevant keys pressed.

While the 's' key of the keyboard is used to save the drawing, the 'space' key provides easy exit.
